1. First we take home price prediction dataset from kaggel.com. Using this dataset we build our machine learning model
2. While building this model we perform data cleaning,feature engineering,dimentionality reduction,outlier removal, one hot encoding
3. Once our model is build we export it to a pickle file
4. Then we write a python flusk server which can consume this pickle file and do price prediction.

Here we use:
Python as programming language
pandas for data cleaning
Matplotlib.pyplot for data visualization
sklearn for model building
python flusk for backend server
HTML, CSS and Java Script for our website.
AWS EC2 is usd to deploy our website
